"Andorra"|"Andorra, a petite principality tucked away in the Pyrenees, overshadowed—literally and figuratively—by its boisterous neighbors, France and Spain. The good news? Its national flag offers a vibrant splash of <span class="color">color</span> that screams, "Hey, we're here too!" Featuring three bold vertical bands of <span class="blue">blue</span>, <span class="yellow">yellow</span>, and <span class="red">red</span>, you'd be forgiven for thinking it's just another tricolor in a sea of similar banners. But look closely. \t The central <span class="yellow">yellow</span> stripe brandishes an ornate coat of arms, a cryptic tapestry of Andorra's intriguing past. There's a nod to the Bishop of Urgell, a hat tip to Catalonia, a wink to Foix, and... two cows for Béarn, because why not? In a world where bigger nations dominate headlines, Andorra's flag whispers a gentle reminder: "Remember us, the tiny nation with the flag that's just a tad extra. Also, did we mention the cows? \t Next time you spot a vibrant tricolor with an emblematic twist, give a nod to Andorra. The mountainous realm that proves size isn't everything... especially when you've got style—and cows."
