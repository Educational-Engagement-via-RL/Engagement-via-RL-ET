Description:
    This script employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to determine the similarity 
    between different national flags. The script processes a set of flag images and outputs 
    similarity scores which are then used by the Reinforcement Learning model to make 
    pedagogical decisions.

Usage:
    python cnn_flags_similarity.py --input_path <../data/flags/..>

Dependencies:
    - PyTorch
